Book store shopping cart app

Introduction to Android Course Project: Book Shopping

Project Description: Flipkart one of the biggest Giants of E-Commerce in the Country is looking for Professionals so that they can develop an Android App of their website. Although this Application will only be dealing with the books category but if your App meets their expectations, they will also include other categories in it. The basic outline for the application is this:

Activity One: This Activity will show the fields for a sign in. Sign in will have Email and Password fields and a button For Sign In. A Sign up option is also needed to be shown in this activity. When user clicks on Sign Up, second activity will be launched. If he clicks on Sign in third activity will be launched.

Activity Two: This activity will show the sign up options,

• Name • Email • Password • Confirm Password After submitting all the details Third Activity is launched.

Activity Three: Products of the selected category can be displayed using a spinner. Images of the products and their prices should be shown somewhere in this Activity and image and price should change when the user select another item from the spinner. When user finally selects a Product, it will be placed in a shopping cart. Third activity is launched.

Activity Four: The items in the shopping cart and their corresponding prices are displayed. At this point items can be deleted form the shopping cart via a method of the developers choosing. You may use buttons, or any other gui element to start the delete function. The items total cost of the items are also displayed (with tax). From Activity three the user can either return to the list and make another purchase or move to the next activity- "Check out." These changes shall be facilitated using buttons.

Activity Five: This activity displays a summary of the purchase which includes items purchased, the cost of each item, the subtotal, the tax amount, the grand total and the name and email address of the customer. This activity needs a button that will restart the P- 0-S system, clear the current purchase and return to the first activity.

Project Requirements: •Create a Java class that represents your inventory. You may use whatever data structure(s) that is convenient to you to store the actual data •Your project must be a good neighbor to other applications on the device •Set an initial tax rate of 6.5% •Since tax rates frequently change, the tax percentage shall be held in a constant that is easily accessed. • While you may select any type of layout you want for the activities, the layout must be clean, functional and easy to navigate.

Progressive Enhancements Once you have the functionality working as described above add and test the following enhancements to your application. Externalize your inventory as a separate document stored on the SD card of the device. This makes it easier to change the inventory or pricing as the single file has only to be swapped out. Use a CSV document to store the information. Have the mobile device make a click or similar noise when an item is selected from the inventory list. Have the device log ALL sales in a CSV or XML file that is saved on the device. All sales information should be included in the log.

Inventory: This is a demo store inventory for your Project having Academic, Arts and Children and Teen books as categories and showing different Products with their prices. You can add more items to your application, with more items you application will look much better.
